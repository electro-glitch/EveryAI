# EveryAI

EveryAI is a powerful AI response aggregator that queries multiple AI models simultaneously, providing rapid, diverse responses in a single execution. By leveraging parallel processing, it significantly reduces wait times, making it ideal for research, content generation, and AI benchmarking. 

_(At present the models used aren't configured to store message history. If you want that let me know!)_

## Features
- ðŸš€ **Parallel AI Processing** â€“ Queries multiple AI models at once for faster responses.
- ðŸ¤– **Multi-Model Support** â€“ Integrates with OpenAI, Azure AI, Mistral, and NVIDIA.
- ðŸ”’ **Secure API Key Handling** â€“ Uses a `.env` file for storing credentials safely.
- ðŸ›  **Scalable & Modular** â€“ Easily add new AI models with minimal changes.
- ðŸ“Š **Diverse AI Responses** â€“ Compare how different models interpret the same prompt.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
```ini
GITHUB_PAT=your_github_marketplace_pat
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_api_key
```
> **Note:** The GitHub Marketplace PAT is used for authenticating multiple AI services, while the NVIDIA API key is specific to NVIDIA's model access.

## Usage
Run EveryAI and interact with multiple AI models at once:
```bash
python main.py
```
Simply enter your prompt and choose whether to query a specific model or get responses from all supported AI models simultaneously.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following installed (handled via `requirements.txt`):
```
openai
azure-ai-inference
azure-core
mistralai
python-dotenv
```

## Contributing
I welcome contributions! If you have ideas for improvements or new model integrations, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request.
